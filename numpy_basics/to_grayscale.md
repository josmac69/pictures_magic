# Description for the to_grayscale.py file

This file contains a function to convert an RGB image to grayscale using the luminosity method.	

## Luminosity method

The luminosity method is a way to convert an RGB image to grayscale using the luminosity method. It is a weighted average of the RGB values, where the weights are the relative luminance of each color channel. The relative luminance of each color channel is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the RGB values. The weights are then normalized so that the sum of the weights is 1.

**Luminance** - the brightness of a color. It is a measure of the amount of light that a color emits or reflects. It is a property of the color that is independent of the color's chrominance (colorfulness).
